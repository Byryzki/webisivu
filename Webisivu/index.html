                Hi, I'm an ICT student from Tampere whose dream is to work with 
                securing systems and devices important to all of us. Also, I wish to learn 
                more about how to make data flow flawlessly in an organization and how we 
                can squeeze maximum amount of knowledge out of that data. 
                My free time passes with corporate relations duties to TiTe guild and
                maintaining IT infrastructure for international guild INTO.

            <p><strong>Space Invaders with PynQ</strong><br>
            As an embedded programming project, we programmed the game classic <em>Space Invaders</em>
            to PynQ-microcontroller with ledmatrix on top. The programming was done using 
            Xilinx as the environment and C as the main language. The task turned out 
            harder than expected and proper documentation was hard to find sometimes.
            However, we were able to produce the proper <em>Space Invaders</em> experience with 
            PynQ and even added some lighting functionalities with assembly.<br>

            <p><strong>Network attached storage with Raspberry Pi</strong><br>
            After finding my cloud storage reaching it's limit, neuron activated in my brain.
            I searched my old Raspberry Pi 3B from a drawer and bought some flash drives.
            Prices of cloud storages are annoyingly high, so I decided to try to host my
            files on-prem. At first I choose the LAMP stack as the bases for Nextcloud and
            then switched to Nginx for better optimization.
            After couple of kernel panics this plan turned out working flawlessly until I found
            out that Nextcloud can support only one driver at the same time. I deployed VPN so
            I could connect to the device from anywhere and NFS to manage files from windows' directory.
            The project took a halt when my roommate disconnected power to the Raspberry Pi 
            while vacuuming corrupting my entire drive.<br>
